# Bovine Bookshelf
This application is a virtual bookshelf showing a collection of books about cows. Books can be viewed, added, edited, and deleted, and changes are stored in local storage. This application is built with React, React Router, and Material-UI.

#### Future Improvements
A more robust, full-stack version using Node, Express, and MySQL is in the works.
